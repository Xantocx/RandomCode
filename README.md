# RandomCode
Here I put all the fun scripts I wrote. Currently, there is only the screen breaker. Hope, you like it.

Uses the following external packages: wx, PIL

If you want to create an exe from the code, install pyinstaller and run "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed RCScreenBreaker.py"

Now worries, it does NOT actually damage your screen :) ESC will end the "screen damage".
