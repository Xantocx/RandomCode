# RandomCode
Here I put all the fun scripts I wrote. Currently, there is only the screen breaker. Hope, you like it.

Uses the following external packages: wx, PIL, msvcrt

If you want to create an exe from the code, install pyinstaller and run "pyinstaller.exe --onefile --windowed RCScreenBreaker.py"
