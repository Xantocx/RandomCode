# RandomCode
Here I put all the fun scripts I wrote. Currently, there is only the screen breaker. Hope, you like it.

Uses the following external packages: wx, PIL

If you want to create an exe from the code, install pyinstaller and run "pyinstaller --onefile --windowed RCScreenBreaker.py"

Now worries, it does NOT actually damage your screen :) ESC will end the "screen damage", but currently the program still continues running (at least the script, I don't know about the exe). So don't forget to terminate it.
